####What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  Prior to my GPS session, I was a little confused on a few aspects of the git flow, including fetch and merge vs git pull and how multiple people can push to the same repository.

####What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  This GPS clarified how the actual process of collaboration on GitHub works with multiple people involved and working on the same project. In addition to getting a chance to ask the questions I mentioned above and having them explained, I also learned how a merge conflict can occur and how it should be resolved first and foremost before moving on.

####What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  I asked a few questions about the naming conventions of files, directories, and branches and the use of "-" vs "_". I also asked about the pros and cons of using fetch and merge vs, a single pull command to bring changes down from the master to your local repo.

####What still confuses you about git?
  I feel as though I have pretty good handle now on the basic steps of checkout, adding/staging, committing, pushing, pulling, and merging. I am a little confused as to how one would revert to a previous commit within git, or find out what changes a commit actually includes without using the interface provided in GitHub.

####How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  I enjoyed the process of the GPS. While at first I felt a bit nervous, as though I was being tested, it soon became apparent that I was just working on a project with a partner and had a guide available if we needed help and to keep us moving in the right direction. Getting to talk through some of the topics weve been learning helped to clarify and solidify them in my head better than simply working on them alone.
