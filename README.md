# phase-0-gps-1

cd phase-0-gps  --> This command navigates to the directory that you want to work in.

git status  --> Tells us the status of the commit and which files are staged for commit and which are untracked.

git add <file> --> Adds or "stages" a file to be committed.

git commit -m ""  --> Commits the changes, or creates a "snapshot" of the current version of your work. It is always good practice to save frequently so that you can always revert back to a previous commit if a mistake is made.

git push origin master  --> pushes or "uploads" the changes you made locally into the remote master repo.

git push origin branch-name --> pushes or "uploads" the changes you made locally into the remote repo for the branch you designate.

git checkout -b branch-name --> creates and navigates to a new "branch" within your remote repo. This allows you to make and push changes without affecting the master until a merge is performed.
